# Etch-A-Sketch

This project is going to be make by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also I'm going to use git branches in order to create my features in different branches. In the end, I will merge all features in main branch. Second version in order to make the button of random colors.

I use more clean code than the older version, this was made searching for a better result and learning more about where and how to call functions and diferent ways to add and event listener in my html elements.
